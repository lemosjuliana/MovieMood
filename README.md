"It will [get worse]. But then it will get better. Then it will get worse again, then better. This is life, and I will not lie by saying that every day will be sunshine. But there will be sunshine again, and that is a very different thing to say. That is truth. I promise you, Kaladin: You will be warm again". Wit to Kaladind, Rythm of War, by Branden Sanderson - Thiago Gouveia
